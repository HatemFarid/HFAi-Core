# HFAi-Core

The master core repository for HFAi systems, prompts, project structures, AI workflows, and automation-ready documentation.

## What lives here
- Canon project structures (folders + rules)
- Prompt libraries (system / personas / tools)
- Workflow playbooks (content, marketing, visuals, education)
- Templates (MD / JSON / checklists)

## Structure (high-level)
- /docs
- /prompts
- /projects
- /templates
- /experiments

## Rules
- Keep everything modular.
- Every project has its own folder under /projects
- Any reusable prompt goes under /prompts
- Any “how-to” goes under /docs
