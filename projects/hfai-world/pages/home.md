# HFAi.world — Home Page Blueprint

## Goal
A cinematic “Universe Entry” that immediately communicates HFAi’s scope and invites exploration.

## Above the Fold (Hero)
- Background: deep-space nebula + starfield (subtle motion)
- Centerpiece: a luminous “Core Planet” (HFAi) with orbiting micro-particles
- Title: Enter the HFAi Universe
- Subtitle: Explore knowledge, personas, tools, and creativity through a living cosmic interface.
- Primary CTA: Enter the Universe Map
- Secondary CTA: Meet the Dream Team

## Core Interaction: Universe Map (First Experience)
- A minimal universe map appears (or expands) after clicking CTA
- 6–8 clickable planets with labels:
  - Personas
  - Knowledge
  - Labs
  - Prompt Engine
  - Vault
  - Applications
  - Academy (optional)
  - Studios (optional)
- Hover shows a 1-line description
- Click triggers a smooth transition into that world

## “Magic Lens” Quick Access (Optional but powerful)
- A floating icon (top right)
- Opens a panel:
  - Choose category (Personas / Tools / Knowledge / Apps)
  - Choose item
  - Jump directly

## Trust + Proof (Short section)
- 3 bullets:
